\section{Background and Motivation}

The background for this thesis was that the municipality of Trondheim (in Sør-Trønderlag county, Norway) wanted to look into improving the performance of their winter road maintenance work. We were approached with the challenge of optimizing the routes they use for their snow plowing operation. After some initial meetings with our supervisors, the municipality, and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA), we had determined the scope of our pre-project which took place in the autumn of 2014.

Our initial research showed that routing is a hard problem and that even with heuristic an exact solution is not guaranteed. Furthermore our resources were limited to one, maybe two semetsters. This contributed to that we soon realized that any solution of sufficient quality we might produce would not be a complete answer to the municipalitys challenge.

An ideal solution would be one that looked at the entrie municipality, divided it into routes for each available vehicle (taking into account both the municipalitys vehicles and those of contractors), while making sure that each route is optimal for the chosen vehicle and that all the required area gets covered. At the same time it should take into consideration the features of each individual piece of road, such as slope, width, number of pedestriant crossings, and what parameters the user wants to optimize for. The durability loss of the vehicles, total distance moved for each vehicles, total time the drivers spend, the environmental impact of the operation, how trafic flow is affected, are all important factors one might want to optimize, and how one weights them may greatly affect the outcome.

The outcome on the other hand, is specified by the NPRA

. In their manuals they have detailed what conditions should be like, how much time can pass before roads of certains types have to be restored to normal operational standards. In the National Road DataBase (NRDB) 
%http://www.vegvesen.no/en/Professional/Roads+and+transport/National+Road+Data+Bank+NRDB
the NPRA specify 10 different classes of roads (Funksjonell vegklasse sorted by Vegklasse). These span all roads from large highways to the smallest bicycle paths and dirt roads the NPRA has records of.

However, because the responsibility of maintaining roads is split between the NPRA and the counties and municipalities (and for various other reasons), the county has their own maps. In their legends, they keep track of the 5 kinds of roads that they are responsible of maintaining. For the rest of this text we will use the countys naming scheme because they have an explicit one, and unlike the NRDB they do not use numbers but actual names to denote the different kinds of roads.

The different types of roads (with our translations) are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fylkesveg (County road)
	\item Kommunalveg (Municipal road)
	\item Boliggate (Street)
	\item GS-veg (abbreviation for Gang- og Sykkelvei, translates to Footpaths and Cycle Paths) %https://www.regjeringen.no/en/topics/municipalities-and-regions/by--og-stedsutvikling/framtidensbyer/area-and-transport/footpaths-and-cycle-paths/id547994/
	\item Sykkelfelt (Bicycle lane/path)
\end{itemize}

The most notable items this list doesn't contain are what is generally labeled as Riksveger, and private roads, because the municipality is not responsible for either. Riksveger entails highways and usually larger roads connecting and passing through counties.

An important part of the municipalitys work is as can be seen maintaining the roads used exclusively by pedestrians and bicycles. This is interesting from a routing perspective, because the network of these roads is highly complex (have lots of intersections/a high degree of connectivity if tought of as a graph), and maintaining them is influenced by and ifluences how the rest of the road network is maintained. For an instance, when clearing snow from the pavement the snow might end up in the road along, and later when clearing the snow from the road the snow might end up back on the pavement.

Unfortunately when processing smaller roads and paths ment for pedestrians and bicycles the NRDB frequently lacks the neccessary data. Fortunately the municipalitys maps have a good overview of these roads and paths, and the NRDB has most metadata that could be considered relevant about the rest of the roads.

Innen AI er det CPP, (NE)ARP (Ref forprosjekt). Basically si at i forprosjektet fant vi at state of the art er x, og her er det.

\section{Goals and Research Questions}

Fordi skala se på optimalisering innenfor eksisterende soner.

Lage grunnleggende form på heuristikk, lett å endre den til å bli bedre etterhvert som man har mer research-ressurster, men er veldig tydelig på at vi ikke optimaliserer det.

Jobbe med eksisterende data så det er lett å holde output oppdatert med det nyeste som finnes av data.

Se om vi i Trondheim kan finne bedre ruter enn de som benyttes fra før av (håntegnede/sjoføren lager selv).

Se om vi i Trondheim kan finne bedre ruter enn de som benyttes fra før hvis vi tar utgangspunkt i eksisterende ruter (strech goal å gjøre dette på en pen måte (ikke hardkodet)).
