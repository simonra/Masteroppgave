\chapter{Mathodology and Implementation}

\subsection{Architectural Overview}
Main components. NVDB and EA, written in python/java, overall workflow.

\subsection{NVDB}

\subsection{Internal Data Model}
Reads graph of standard format -> Finds all pairs shortest paths using floyd warshall (mention the neat trick of including destination cost)

\subsection{Evolutionary Algorithm}
input: tweakable param files -> pseudocode presented as text -> mention about the memetic part

\subsection{Heurisitc}
What we implemented 
-> arguing for why these are good and importat things 
-> mentioning that this doesn't solve the multi vehicle split that is oh so standard in the literature (because not relevant for our 1 car use case) 
	-> It could possibly be used to solve some other of trondheims probles though 
-> mentioning what we don't take into consideration, and why one might want to look into that (ex impact of weather, slope of roads, curvature, etc)
