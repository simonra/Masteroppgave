\section{Evaluation}
Evaluation of results

\section{Discussion}
Discussion of results

\section{Contributions}
How do our findings contribute to the field. Of what signifficance are our findings?

\section{Future Work}
What we didn't do but know that could be done

\subsection{Improve Performance}
Much of the code could be parallized, perhaps altered so that it can run on gpu-s

Reduce constant factors (of running time (ex some loops could be n\^2 instead of 2\*n\^2)).

\subsection{Better Heuristic}
Several vehicle types and ability to divide into zones

Take todays weather into consideration (ie. make a real-time system, and differentiate between emergency servicing and maintenace work).

Give output in terms of not only what we currently do, but also total distance, amount of fuel spent, time spent, vehicle durability (how much is their lifespan reduced by by doing the suggested route), or environmental impact. This will allow the operator to choose what to optimize, and it could even be a weighting among all the different evaluation types. Input could then for an instance be fuel > time > distance > environmental impact, or 90\% environment, 80\% fuel, 85\%time, etc.
