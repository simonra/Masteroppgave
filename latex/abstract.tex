In this thesis route optimization for snow plowing in Trondheim municipality (Norway) has been explored. The routes have been optimized with respect to total distance, weighted by speed limits, using a memetic algorithm. The model of the underlying road network is based on maps from the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, and the pre-existing routes used for verification were supplied by Trondheim municipality. The results were that the algorithm managed to improve on the routes which are currently being driven, but the model needs refining if the resulting routes are to be used in practice.
